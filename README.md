# Hashing-Project-java-
Overload the following methods to handle Integer data instead of String data
 getHashIndex
 linearProbing
 quadraticProbing
 doubleHashing
2. Create a new Hash Table to store Integer data
3. Create an Integer array to store the numbers given.
 Store the following data in a hash table.
627, 378, 549, 432, 148, 121, 528, 402, 246, 599, 85, 359, 195, 345, 212, 187, 525, 393, 632, 143
4. Iterate over array to add numbers to the hash table. (The same way that it was done for
the names) Comment out the loop that does it for the String values.
5. Eliminate the third print statement that calls method hashcode(name)
Output hash code for each value, deal with collisions and show how the data would be stored for
linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing. Call only one of the methods at a time and
copy and paste output for each method.
Show all output.
